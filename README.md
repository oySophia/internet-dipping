internet-dipping
================

I have tried some internet experiment with socket and some protocals such as icmp .etc.

touchserver.c is a file you can send a string to a certain server, whose actual address can be given in the codes, and some tips are given in a friendly way while you are testing.

traceroute.c is such a file you can ping to some server normally, and also in the unusual way with icmp protocal, what's more, you can complete a ping funciton with such example. 
Besides, I've enclosed my understanding of imcp protocal in txt2.txt with my referred sites.
